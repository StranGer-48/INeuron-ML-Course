# AI vs ML vs DL vs DS

AI is an umbrella discipline that covers everythinf related to making machines smarter. Machine Learning(ML) is commonly used along with AI but it is a subset of AI. ML refers to ana AI system that can self-learn based on the algorithm. Systems that ger smarter and smarter over time without human intervention is ML. Deep Learning(DL) is machine learning applied to large data sets. Most AI works involves ML because behaviour requires considerable knowledge. Data Scientist should have knowledge of AL, ML, and DL.

## Artificial Intelligence 

**[Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)(AI)**, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, which is unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. AI is concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdiciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every secctor of the tech industry. 

**Application:**
  * Netflix    --> Recommendation System
  * Amazom.in  --> Product Recommendation
  * Self Driving Cars
  * Smart assistants (like Siri and Alexa)
  * Spam filters on email
  * Optimized, personalized healthcare treatment recommendatio

## Machine Learning

**[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)(ML)**, is  subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from exprience withour being explicitly programmed. ML focuses on the development of computer program that can access data and use it learn to themselvsML provides stats tools to analyse the data, prediction models, recommendation systems and etc. ML are usually of three types
supervised ML, unsupervised ML, and reinforcement ML.
 
**[Supervised ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning):**
 
Supervised ML algorithms can applu what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. In this method each example is a pair consisting of an input object(typically a vector) and a desired output value. A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. Supervised ML is of two types: Classification and Regression.

**Classification** is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations(or instances) whose category membership is known. Examples are assigning a given eamil to the "spam" or "non-spam" class, and assiging a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient(sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).

**Regression** analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the reationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression. Regrssion analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes. First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substancial overlap with the field of machine learning. Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal realtionships between the independent and dependent variables.

**Algorithms:**
 * Naive Bayes classifier
 * Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
 * Support Vector Machine
 * Random Forest
 * Maximum entropy classifier
 * Artificial neural network

**Applications:**
 * Handwriting recognition
 * informatin extraction
 * Spam detection
 * Pattern recognition
 * Speech recognition

**[Unsupervised ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning):**

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. Cluster analysis is used i unsupervised learning to group, or segment, datasets with shared attributes in order to extrapolate algorithmic relationships. Cluster analysis is a branch of machine learning that groups the data that has not been labelled, classified or categorized. 

**Approaches:**
 * Hierachical clustering
 * K-means
 * DBSCAN
 * K-nearest neighbor clustering
 

**[Reinforcement ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning):**

Reinforcement learning is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.
