AI is an umbrella discipline that covers everythinf related to making machines smarter. Machine Learning(ML) is commonly used along with AI but it is a subset of AI. ML refers to ana AI system that can self-learn based on the algorithm. Systems that ger smarter and smarter over time without human intervention is ML. Deep Learning(DL) is machine learning applied to large data sets. Most AI works involves ML because behaviour requires considerable knowledge. Data Scientist should have knowledge of AL, ML, and DL.
